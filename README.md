## Lasermindâ€™s music archive

Find here the releases of music that I made. (Surprise: so far it is one song.)

You can download it and use it according to the FREE-NA Licence attached. You can find out more about The FREE Licence Project here: <https://github.com/thefreelicence>.

Downloads are available as 320k MP3 and 16bit WAV.

Find me also on other platforms, such as:

Cheers!

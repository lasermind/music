to body or mind of a living being or (ii) violates, erodes or undermines the 
freedom or self-determination of a living being or (iii) damages, destroys or
purloins property or possession of a living being — exempt a defence against
such an act of aggression.

“Use” in the sense of this agreement means: to share, copy, distribute, stream,
broadcast, play back, exhibit, perform, recite, quote, mention, publish, include,
bundle, embed or otherwise publicise — in conventional or future ways —, or

As an informal part of the licence text, here are some additional suggestions:

ATTRIBUTION
Although the licence does not require you to attribute the creator, you can,
however, do best in the following way:

Lasermind — Club of the free
Lasermind — Club of the free (Radio Edit)

… depending on the track you’re using.


COMPATIBLE LICENCES
Since FREE-NA requires you to release derivative work under the same licence or
a compatible one, a list of compatible licences would be helpful. Unfortunately,
so far no compatible licences are known of, since all allow the use of the work
for aggressive acts.
